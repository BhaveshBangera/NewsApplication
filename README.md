# NewsApplication
This a basic News Application created using Python's Django Framework. In this application, user can search news about any topics they want. The topics can be related to any person, any location, any fields etc. Once the user searches for the topic, the topic name is stored in the database, and accordingly an API Call is made for that topic. The result is fetched in the JSON Format and displayed in the front page. For improving the display of the page, Bootstrap framework is used. The API data is being fetched from the website of News API only after registering and providing Proper API Key.
